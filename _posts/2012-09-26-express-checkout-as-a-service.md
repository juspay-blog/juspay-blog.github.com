#### CRH2 High Speed Train
The picture posted above is of the CRH2 high speed train model in China. The maximum speed of this train is 350 km/h. Such high speed trains are not just technology marvel. These are symbols of efficiency. 

Every country puts a lot of effort to ensure that her citizens are healthy so that they can be more efficient and productive. The major differentiator between developed rich country like Germany and emerging economy like India is the social security programme. A responsible Govt strives to ensure that her citizens are healthy and thereby become more productive and efficient. This contributes to the GDP and tax income for the Govt. 

Just like a country, every ecosystem focuses on ensuring that its sub-systems are efficient. A great country needs a great economy. A great economy needs an efficient financial system. This brings us to the payments infrastructure issue. Just like good roads are required for efficient travel, a great payments infrastructure is required for efficient functioning of online economy. 
  
#### Express Checkout
  
Express Checkout is our first step to bring in efficiency to the system. In a typical checkout system, there are 7 steps involved before the checkout process is completed. Express Checkout reduces this to __2 simple steps__. From our analysis, we have observed that the entire checkout process can be completed in less than 15 seconds. This keeps the entropy to an extreme minimum.

Redirection leads to dead ends. Express Checkout retains the customer on the checkout page until the completion of payment. This reduces the frustration level for the customer, should the payment operation fail, for whatever reasons technical/non-technical. This increases the satisfaction level of customers and reduces abandonment rates of shopping carts. A typical merchant faces about ~65% of shopping cart abandonment. Express Checkout helps improve the situation. An approximate estimate of business improvement can be found here - [https://merchant.juspay.in/gain/](https://merchant.juspay.in/gain/ "Shopping Cart Improvement").
